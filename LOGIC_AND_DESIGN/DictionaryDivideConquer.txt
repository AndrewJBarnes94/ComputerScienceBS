START
    1. Prepare variables:
            Declare and initialize target_word as a string
            Declare and initialize middle_page as integer
            Declare minimum_page as an integer
            Declare maximum_page as an integer

    2. Go to middle_page
            Is target_word on the page?
                If yes:
                    target_word has been found
                    STOP
                If no:
                    If target_word comes before middle_page:
                        Set maximum_page to middle_page
                        Set minimum_page to lowest uncheck page value
                    If target_word comes after middle_page:
                        Set minimum_page to middle_page
                        Set maximum_page to highest unchecked page value
                    Set middle_page to minimum_page + ((maximum_page - minimum_page) / 2)
                        Go back to step 2
