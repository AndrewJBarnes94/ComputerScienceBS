# Program Name: Final Portfolio Project - Automobile Inventory Program
# Program Author: Andrew Barnes
# Program Objective: Create an automobile class to be used as a vehicle inventory 
#                    program for a dealership. The program should allow the 
#                    addition, removal and updating of vehicles in the inventory, 
#                    and output the final inventory to a text file.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pseudocode: 1. Define the Automobile class with private attributes: make, model,
#                color, year, and mileage.
#             2. Define the appropriate methods in the class: constructor,
#                add a new vehicle, remove a vehicle, and update vehicle attributes.
#             3. Implement user interface for interacting with the inventory: adding, 
#                removing, updating vehicles, and exporting the inventory.
#             4. Allow the user to export the inventory to a text file at the end of 
#                their session.
